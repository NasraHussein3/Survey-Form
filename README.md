# Survey-Form
##Mini-project

This is the first project I did within the FreeCodeCamp Reponsive Web Design course. I used HTML and CSS to create a form for a web App. 
These images below are screenshots of the webapp form:

There was alot of learning in this project:
1. Gained proficiency in a programming language and its syntax.
2. Learned how to set up a development environment for coding.
3. Acquired problem-solving skills by identifying and resolving coding issues and errors.

I look forward to comparing this project with my next few projects as i continue to excell in coding.
